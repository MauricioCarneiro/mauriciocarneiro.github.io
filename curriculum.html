             Mauricio Carneiro was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on February 11, 1980. His interest
             in computer science began at an early age, and he was soon enrolled in a technical high
             school with a focus on computer science. During his days as an undergraduate at
             Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-RIO), nationally regarded as the
             best computer engineering university in Brazil, he competed in multiple computer science
             contests. Most notably, he represented PUC-RIO for three years at the International
             Collegiate Programming Contest, the most competitive international tournament for
             computer programming for college students. He won South American Champion in 2003, and
             at the world finals was awarded the Upsilon pi Epsilon (UPE) Programming Excellence. The
             UPE is a society that promotes academic excellence in computing and information
             disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>
             He won multiple scholarships to pursue research in computer graphics and advanced
             algorithms throughout his time at PUC-RIO. In 2003 he was awarded a scholarship from
             the Brazilian Research Council to work as a junior researcher in molecular
             epidemiology.  It was during this time that he developed an interest in computational
             biology, and decided to pursue a Masters of Science in molecular biology at Oswaldo
             Cruz Foundation and Institute (Rio de Janeiro), with the aid of a full scholarship from
             the Brazilian Research Council. With this training under his belt, and with a full
             commitment to applying his computational knowledge to the growing field of computation
             genomics, he applied, and was accepted, into the PhD program at Harvard University's
             Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, with acclaimed geneticist Dr. Daniel
             Hartl.
            </p>
            <p>
             During his graduate training, Dr. Carneiro drew on his computational background to
             develop a method for understanding the dynamics of drug resistance in the malaria
             parasite. This culminated in a highly influential paper published in the Proceedings of
             the National Academy of Sciences. In addition, he worked on the annotation and analysis
             of the first Drosophila mauritiana genome, which was published in Genome Biology and
             Evolution. Finally, he collaborated with noted Harvard mathematics professor Cliff
             Taubes to develop a mathematical model for the evolution of gene networks. This work
             was published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
            </p>
            <p>
             As his formal education drew to an end, Dr. Carneiro was recruited to apply his expertise at the
             Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The Broad Institute is arguably the premier genomics research
             center in the world, and a powerful driver of innovation in the field. Dr. Carneiro joined the
             Medical and Population Genetics Program at the Broad, where he began his career as a Computational
             Biologist.
            </p>
            <p>
             Within his first year at the Broad Institute, Dr. Carneiro made major contributions to
             the field of DNA sequence analysis, especially as it applied to disease discovery. For
             example, his data compression algorithm enabled the analysis of tens of thousands of
             individuals simultaneously, which allowed disease researchers to find very rare (and
             previously missed) causal mutations for complex diseases, such as diabetes and
             schizophrenia.  Before this innovation, the analysis was limited to only a few hundred
             individuals at a time, and left out crucial information about these individuals'
             genomes. This compression algorithm is now the gold standard for large-scale DNA
             sequence analysis, and has been patented under US PCT Patent US13/31429 "Systems and
             methods for reducing representations of genome sequencing data". Dr. Carneiro also
             identified an unmet need for replication and validation of large-scale data sets in
             disease studies. To address this gap, he created a study design, sequencing protocol
             and computational algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of sequencing a large
             number of individuals. This procedure is now being successfully used at the Broad
             Institute and is currently under patent processing. 
            </p>
            <p>
             Based on his outstanding performance, Dr. Carneiro was quickly promoted to a leadership
             role, and in his second year at the Broad, became Group Lead in Computational
             Technology Development. In this new role, Dr. Carneiro has contributed to major
             advances in DNA sequencing such as the new analytical methods for exome sequencing and
             small target resequencing studies, again reducing the cost of large sequencing projects
             and further enabling the research of complex diseases. His group has also played an
             important role disseminating information on how to use and apply computational
             analytics to DNA sequencing data including but not limited to human data. His group
             organized several workshops and distributed videotaped lectures for free in the Broad
             Institute's website.
            </p>
            <p>
             During his time at the Broad Institute, Dr. Carneiro has been invited to speak at the
             top conferences in his field, including twice at the cornerstone conference in genome
             sequencing technology, Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT). Dr. Carneiro
             has also published six highly cited papers in top journals, including two in Nature,
             one in Nature Communications, as well as papers in BMC Genomics, Current Protocols in
             Bioinformatics, and Genome Biology. The last paper in Genome Biology, entitled "The
             advantages of SMRT sequencing" was a collaboration between Dr.  Carneiro and Nobel
             Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, Sir Richard Roberts. Sir Roberts reached out
             personally to Dr. Carneiro because of Dr. Carneiro’s expertise in DNA sequence
             analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
             The majority of Dr. Carneiro's work at the Broad has been, and continues to be,
             compiled into his software compendium known as the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK),
             which is freely available to the scientific community. The GATK quickly became the
             worldwide industry standard for DNA sequencing data analysis. The GATK surpassed the
             100 million run mark in August 2013, and has been used by close to 10,000 researchers
             and clinicians, from academic and institutions and commercial companies alike. The
             numbers keep growing, and everyday, at least twenty to thirty new users join the GATK
             support forum to download the software, read documentation, and ask questions about the
             GATK analysis tools and methods. This is a testament to the fact that the GATK is the
             most widely used software package for analysis of genome information, not only of
             humans, but of a broad range of organisms, by researchers across the world.

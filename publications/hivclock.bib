	abstract = {Detailed knowledge about the rate of the genetic variation is vital for understanding how HIV induces disease and develops resistance, as well as for studies on the molecular epidemiology and origin of the virus. The molecular clock hypothesis in molecular evolutionary studies has been controversial since it was first proposed (Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965). A variety of methods have been developed to test the molecular clock and these have been applied to many studies, including the molecular evolution of viruses. The many studies and discussions about the existence of a molecular clock suitable to the different genes of the HIV-1 have been based on very small data sets what could likely create biased results. In this study, we tested 179 HIV-1 sequences extracted from the GeneBank, with the motifs most expressive in Brazil (Monica, 2004). The resulting Likelihood Ratio test (Felsenstein, 1981) rejected the molecular clock hypothesis for the env V3 region. This casts doubts on the validity of recent attempts to date the origin of the epidemic.}

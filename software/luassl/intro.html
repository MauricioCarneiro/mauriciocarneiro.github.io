<h2><a name="intro">Quickstart</a></h2>
<p>Below is a little introduction on how to get the library up and
running with your applications and a little introduction on secure 
network programming with LuaSSL.  </p>


<h2><a name="init">Initializing the library</a></h2>
<p>First of all, you'll need OpenSSL 0.9.6 or higher installed on
your machine. If you are going to compile the sources of LuaSSL,
you'll also need to have the Kerberos' include files (as OpenSSL makes
use of them), and you may be required to change the directory in 
makefile that points to it.</p>

<p>To have the library functions made available to a Lua script, the
interpreter running the script must be linked to the <tt>luassl</tt>
library. The functions are registered in the Lua state given as the
parameter to the function <tt>luaopen_ssllib</tt>, the only C
function exported by the library. The scripts can then use all
registered functions. </p>


<h2> <a name="prog"> Secure Network programming with LuaSSL </a></h2>
<p>The network support in the Lua language could closely mirror the C API
or could implement a new, independent, transport layer abstraction.
Having an API similar to the C API would make things easier for those
who are used to socket programming. On the other hand, the simplicity of
the Lua language would be lost. We ended up with something in between,
in the sense that function names and semantics have been copied from the
C API whenever possible, whereas their usage in Lua has been greatly
simplified. Add to that, the strong possibility that this library will
become a joint project with <tt>luasocket</tt>, what greatly suggests
that we mimic it's interface.</p>

<p>The first point to be made between plain network connections (done using
luasocket) and secure connections, is that by using SSL you're paying both
processing time and amount of data sent, to make things secure. Another 
important point is that you can use all levels of security with SSL, since
the most unprotected traffic (almost simillar to plain connections) to the
most complex security handled communication.</p>

<p>Although these options are made available through the huge C API of OpenSSL,
the Lua binding does not intend to fully supply you with these options. Rather
the LuaSSL API is pretty small, aiming a simpler way to make well secured
applications.</p>

<p>A good comparison here between the C and LUA API's can be found by the ECHO 
example :</p>

<h3>Server Code</h3>
A simple echo server with SSL connection, doing handshake, RSA key exchanging 
and certification (server key file : <i>server.pem</i> and certificate :
<i>rootcert.pem</i>) and kindly closing the connection with a EOF.

<pre>
    function server_loop(s)
        while true do
            local a, e = s:read()
            if e == 0 then return true -- 0 for end of file
            else if e then return false end end -- halt on anything else
            io.write(a)
        end
        return true
    end


    local s = ssl.wrap("keys/server.pem", "keys/rootcert.pem", nil, "keys/dh1024.pem")
    s:bind(16001)

    while true do 
        s:accept()
        print("Connection Opened") 
        if server_loop(s) then
            s:shutdown()
            print("Connection Closed") 
        else
            s:clear()
            print("Connection Cleared")
        end
    end
</pre>

<h3>Client Code</h3>
The equivalent client that successfully connects with all SSL requirements 
and keeps sending data until EOF is entered (in unix : CTRL+D, windows: CTRL+z).

<pre>
    function client_loop (s)
        while true do
            local a = io.read("*l")
            if a == nil then break end 
            local e = s:write(a.."\n")
            if e then return false end
        end
        return true
    end

    local s = ssl.wrap("keys/client.pem", "keys/rootcert.pem")
    s:connect("localhost", 16001)
    print("Connection Opened")
    if (client_loop(s)) then
        print("Connection Closed")
        s:shutdown()
    else
        print("Connection Cleared")
        s:clear()
    end
    s:free()
</pre>


<h3>C code</h3>
The equivalent C code for this application has 4 files and about 400 lines
of code.  You can download it <a href="http://www.opensslbook.com/code.html">here</a>.

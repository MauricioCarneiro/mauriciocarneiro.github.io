<p><h2><a name"funcs">Class Functions</a></h2></p>
<p><a name="wrap"><tt><b>ssl.wrap(</b>key, certificate [, certdir, dhfile, cipherlist, verify_options, options]<b>)</b></tt></a></p>
<p>This is the most important function for the SSL context to be created
with the user preferences. Several default values are already configured
so that it's not really needed to know much about each of these options 
to get your connection secure and running. Although it is highly recommended
that you know what your doing.</p>
<ul>
    <li> <i>key</i> : The Private Key file in PEM format for the Application (or 
         the person)</li><br>
    <li> <i>certificate</i> : The Certificate Chain file in PEM format starting 
         with the Certificate for the application and ending with the 
         rootCA certificate. The file may contain more than one certificate.</li><br>
    <li> <i>certidir</i> : The name of a directory containing CA certificates.
         Each file in the directory must contain only a single CA certificate,
         and the files must be named by the subject's name hash and an
         extension of ".0".</li><br>
    <li> <i>dhfile </i> : The file with the Diffie Hellman parameters for
         ephemeral keying to be used. Ephemeral keying is explained 
         <a href="references.html#ephemeral">here</a>.</li><br>
    <li> <i>cipherlist</i> : list of ciphers to be used or not to be used in the 
         connections. The patterns for this list are described 
         <a href="references.html#cipherlist">here</a>. <tt>Default: 
         "ALL:!ADH:!LOW:!EXP:!MD5:@STRENGTH".</tt></li><br>
    <li> <i>verify_options</i> : The sum of all options you want to set up for 
         your peer verification procedure. The verify options are listed 
         <a href="references.html#verify_options">here</a>. <tt>Default: 
         SSL_VERIFY_PEER.</tt></li><br>
    <li> <i>options</i> : The sum of all general options you want to set up for
         your SSL context. The options are listed 
         <a href="references.html#options">here</a>. <tt>Default: SSL_OP_ALL + 
         SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2</tt></li><br>
</ul>
<p>This function returns a ssl object <tt>s</tt>, which is the object you'll use 
for all your ssl operations described in the next section</p>


<p><h2><a name="meth">SSL Object Methods</a></h2></p>

<p><a name="accept"><tt><b>s:accept( )</b></tt></a></p>
<p>Waits for an SSL client to attempt connection. It is responsible for 
the first negotiations with the SSL client. They negotiate which 
authentication method to use, which cipher and exchange public 
keys/certificates to proove the authencity of both sides. If Ephemeral
keying with Diffie Hellman algorithm is enabled with <tt>SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE</tt>,
all this negotiation is done using ephemeral keying.</p>

<p><a name="bind"><tt><b>s:bind(</b>port<b>)</b></tt></a></p>
<p>binds the <tt>s</tt> to the specified <tt>port</tt> on the local host. 
Pay attention to the fact that only SSL servers can be bound to a socket,
so <i>do not</i> use this function for connecting.</p>

<p><a name="clear"><tt><b>s:clear( )</b></tt></a></p>
<p>Safely closes a broken connection. Broken means that the peer has
disconnected without negotiating a shutdown.</p>

<p><a name="connect"><tt><b>s:connect(</b>address, port [, 
exp_conn] <b>)</b></tt></a></p>
<p>Make an attempt to connect to (<tt>address</tt>, <tt>port</tt>). 
<tt>Address</tt> can be an IP address or a host name. It also performs
all the negotiations needed by the SSL connection, and authenticates both 
the client and the server, exchanging keys and certificates. If Ephemeral
keying with Diffie Hellman algorithm is enabled with <tt>SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE</tt>,
all this negotiation is done using <a 
href="references.html#ephemeral">ephemeral keying</a>.</p>
<p>The optional parameter <tt>exp_conn</tt> stands for a post connection
verification routine in which you will check the certificate sent
by the peer, first of all, if it was really sent (i.e. this only makes
sense if you are NOT using SSL_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERTIFICATE). It also
checks if the name recorded in the certificate is the same as 
<tt>exp_conn</tt>, which means "the peer you were expecting".</p>


<p><a name="read"><tt><b>s:read( )</tt></b></a></p>
<p>
The function returns the decoded buffer read from the connection socket. 
In case of error it returns <tt>nil</tt> and the error code, which can be
<tt>0</tt> for a "connection terminated" or <tt>< 0</tt> for any problem 
that might have occurred.
</p>


<p><a name="renegotiate"><tt><b>s:renegotiate( )</b></tt></a></p>
<p>SSL renegotiation is essentially an SSL handshake during a connection.
This causes client credentials to be reevaluated and a new session to be 
created. It doesnt check *yet* if the handshake has been succesfully done
since it depends on timeout. 


<p><a name="shutdown"><tt><b>s:shutdown( )</b></tt></a></p>
<p>Shuts the SSL connection stablished by <tt>s</tt> down. The 
shutdown handshake and negotiations are performed by both server and
the client, and the local address to which <tt>s</tt> was bound 
is made available to other applications. No further operations (except 
for further calls to <tt>close</tt>) are allowed on a closed object.</p>
<p>Note: It is important to shutdown all used objects once they are not
needed, since, in many systems, each socket uses a file descriptor,
which are a limited system resource. </p>


<p><a name="write"><tt><b>s:write(</b>string<b>)</b></tt></a></p>
<p>Writes the <tt>string</tt> encripted through the socket. The 
function returns an error code, which is <tt>nil</tt> in case of success, 
Or anything less than 0 if any error have occurred. </p>

<br>

<p><h2><a name="attributes">Attributes</a></h2></p>
<p>The attributes of LuaSSL are exactly the same of the constants exported by 
OpenSSL. If you are already familiar with OpenSSL, you can just adapt to Lua 
way of summing them up.</p>

<p>In OpenSSL one could make the choice of having the peer verified and to fail
no certificate were issued by the other part with the following sentence:</p>
<pre>
    SSL_VERIFY_PEER | SSL_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT
</pre>

<p>As in lua these constants became numbers, this summing becomes intuitively:</p>
<pre>
    ssl.VERIFY_PEER + ssl.FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT
</pre>

<p>There are two groups of constants which may be added together, they are listed 
below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a name="verify_options"><h3>Verify Options:</h3></a>
    <p><b><tt>Default: ssl.VERIFY_PEER</tt></b></p>
    <ul>
        <li> <tt>ssl.VERIFY_NONE</tt><br><br> No request for a certificate is sent. Any
             certificate received will be verified but will not terminate
             the handshake in a failure.</li><br>
        <li> <tt>ssl.VERIFY_PEER</tt><br><br> 
             A request for a certificate will be made 
             but this request may be ignored. If a certificate is sent back
             it will be verified. If the verification fails, the handshake
             is terminated immediately.</li><br>
        <li> <tt>ssl.VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT</tt><br><br> 
             If <tt>SSL_VERIFY_PEER</tt>
             is not set, this flag is ignored. Use of this flag will cause the
             handshake to terminate immediately if no certificate is provided by
             the peer.</li><br>
        <li> <tt>ssl.VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE</tt><br><br> 
             If <tt>SSL_VERIFY_PEER</tt>
             is not set, this flag is ignored. Use of this flag will prevent
             the server from requesting a certificate from the client in the 
             case of a renegotiation. A certificate will still be requested 
             during the initial handshake.</li><br>
     </ul>
     <li<a name="options"><h3>General Options:</h3></a>
     <p>These options change the behavior of the SSL context. Their main
     goal is to fix some bugs related to previous versions so they still
     compatible with the current one. ssl.OP_ALL turns on all the bugs
     workarounds for compatibility issues, meaning that no bugs (from the
     listed ones) related to older versions will affect the connection.
     ssl.OP_NO_SSLv2 as it implies, do not allow connections with version 2
     of the secure socket layer for it is insecure to do that since SSLv2
     has major bugs, fixed by SSLv3 and TLS.  The default will do for almost
     all cases.</p>
     <p><b><tt>Default: ssl.OP_ALL + ssl.OP_NO_SSLv2</tt></b></p>
     <ul>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_MICROSOFT_SESS_ID_BUG</tt>
        <p>www.microsoft.com -
        when talking SSLv2, if session-id reuse is performed, the
        session-id passed back in the server-finished message is different
        from the one decided upon.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_NETSCAPE_CHALLENGE_BUG</tt>
        <p>Netscape-Commerce/1.12, when talking SSLv2, accepts a 32 byte
        challenge but then appears to only use 16 bytes when generating the
        encryption keys. Using 16 bytes is ok but it should be ok to use
        32. According to the SSLv3 spec, one should use 32 bytes for the
        challenge when operating in SSLv2/v3 compatibility mode, but as
        mentioned above, this breaks this server so 16 bytes is the way to
        go.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG</tt>
        <p>ssl3.netscape.com:443, first a connection is established
        with RC4-MD5. If it is then resumed, we end up using DES-CBC3-SHA.
        It should be RC4-MD5 according to 7.6.1.3, 'cipher_suite'.</p>
        
        <p>Netscape-Enterprise/2.01 (https://merchant.netscape.com) has
        this bug. It only really shows up when connecting via SSLv2/v3
        then reconnecting via SSLv3. The cipher list changes....</p>
            
        <p>NEW INFORMATION. Try connecting with a cipher list of just
        DES-CBC-SHA:RC4-MD5. For some weird reason, each new
        connection uses RC4-MD5, but a re-connect tries to use
        DES-CBC-SHA. So netscape, when doing a re-connect, always
        takes the first cipher in the cipher list.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_SSLREF2_REUSE_CERT_TYPE_BUG</tt><p></p></li>

        <p>Disables a countermeasure against a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 protocol
        vulnerability affecting CBC ciphers, which cannot be handled by
        some broken SSL implementations. This option has no effect for
        connections using other ciphers.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_ALL</tt>
        <p>All of the above bug workarounds.</p>
        <p>It is usually safe to use SSL_OP_ALL to enable the bug workaround
        options if compatibility with somewhat broken implementations is
        desired.</p>
        
        <p>The following modifying options are available:</p> 
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_TLS_ROLLBACK_BUG</tt>
        <p>Disable version rollback attack detection.</p>
        <p>During the client key exchange, the client must send the
        same information about acceptable SSL/TLS protocol levels
        as during the first hello. Some clients violate this rule
        by adapting to the server's answer. (Example: the client
        sends a SSLv2 hello and accepts up to
        SSLv3.1=TLSv1, the server only understands up to
        SSLv3. In this case the client must still use the
        same SSLv3.1=TLSv1 announcement. Some clients step
        down to SSLv3 with respect to the server's answer
        and violate the version rollback protection.) </p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION</tt>
        <p>When performing renegotiation as a server, always start a new
        session (i.e., session resumption requests are only accepted in the
        initial handshake). This option is not needed for clients.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_SINGLE_DH_USE</tt>
        <p>Always create a new key when using temporary/ephemeral DH
        parameters. This option must be used to prevent small subgroup 
        attacks, when the DH parameters were not generated using 
        ``strong'' primes (e.g. when using DSA-parameters). If ``strong'' 
        primes were used, it is not strictly necessary to generate a new 
        DH key during each handshake but it is also recommended. 
        SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE should therefore be enabled whenever 
        temporary/ephemeral DH parameters are used.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA</tt>
        <p>Always use ephemeral (temporary) RSA key when doing RSA 
        operations According to the
        specifications this is only done, when a RSA key can only be used
        for signature operations (namely under export ciphers with
        restricted RSA keylength). By setting this option,
        ephemeral RSA keys are always used. This option breaks
        compatibility with the SSL/TLS specifications and may lead
        to interoperability problems with clients and should
        therefore never be used. Ciphers with EDH (ephemeral
        Diffie-Hellman) key exchange should be used
        instead.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE</tt>
        <p>When choosing a cipher, use the server's preferences instead of
        the client preferences. When not set, the SSL server will always
        follow the clients preferences. When set, the SSLv3/TLSv1 server
        will choose following its own preferences. Because of the different
        protocol, for SSLv2 the server will send his list of preferences to
        the client and the client chooses.</p> 
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_NO_SSLv2</tt>
        <p>Do not use the SSLv2 protocol.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_NO_SSLv3</tt>
        <p>Do not use the SSLv3 protocol.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1</tt>
        <p>Do not use the TLSv1 protocol.</p>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_PKCS1_CHECK_1</tt><p></p></li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_PKCS1_CHECK_2</tt><p></p></li>
        <li><tt>ssl.OP_NETSCAPE_CA_DN_BUG</tt>
        <p>If we accept a netscape connection, demand a client cert, have a
        non-self-signed CA which does not have its CA in netscape, and the
        browser has a cert, it will crash/hang. Works for 3.x and 4.xbeta </p>

     </ul>
</ul>

<h3><a name="cipherlist">Cipher Listing</a></h3>
<p>The list of ciphers to be used by the application may be optionally determined
in Lua. Since the default cipher list is both careful and complete, you may
never need to specify a cipher list yourself, but if your are working with some
specificity, you'll have to tell the SSL context which ciphers to use.</p>

<p>For instance "ALL" is a shortcut for every available combination. Additionally, we can precede a keyword with the "!" operator to remove all ciphers associated with the keyword. Using this we will create a string to define our custom cipher list. There are other operators such as "+" or "-", but they are not essential for specifying a secure list. For applications that need a custom definition, the ciphers manpage of the OpenSSL is a good reference on string formation.</p>

<p>A brief description of the keywords follows here:</p>

<ul>
    <li>DEFAULT: the default cipher list is "ALL:!ADH:!LOW:!EXP:!MD5:@STRENGTH".
    </li><br> 

    <li>ALL: all ciphers suites except the eNULL ciphers which must be explicitly 
        enabled.</li><br>

    <li>HIGH: "high" encryption cipher suites. This currently means those with
key lengths larger than 128 bits. </li><br>

    <li>MEDIUM: "medium" encryption cipher suites, currently those using 128 bit
    encryption.</li><br>

    <li>LOW: "low" encryption cipher suites, currently those using 64 or 56 bit
    encryption algorithms but excluding export cipher suites.</li><br>
    
    <li>EXP, EXPORT: export encryption algorithms. Including 40 and 56 bits algorithms.</li><br>

    <li>EXPORT40: 40 bit export encryption algorithms</li><br>

    <li>EXPORT56: 56 bit export encryption algorithms.</li><br>

    <li>eNULL, NULL: the "NULL" ciphers that is those offering no encryption. 
    Because these offer no encryption at all and are a security risk they are
    disabled unless explicitly included.</li><br>

    <li>aNULL: the cipher suites offering no authentication. This is currently the
    anonymous DH algorithms. These cipher suites are vulnerable to a
    "man in the middle" attack and so their use is normally discouraged.</li><br>

    <li>kRSA, RSA: cipher suites using RSA key exchange.</li><br>

    <li>kEDH: cipher suites using ephemeral DH key agreement.</li><br>

    <li>kDHr, kDHd: cipher suites using DH key agreement and DH certificates 
    signed by CAs with RSA and DSS keys respectively. Not implemented.</li><br>

    <li>aRSA: cipher suites using RSA authentication, i.e. the certificates carry
    RSA keys.</li><br>

    <li>aDSS, DSS: cipher suites using DSS authentication, i.e. the certificates carry
    DSS keys.</li><br>

    <li>TLSv1, SSLv3, SSLv2: TLS v1.0, SSL v3.0 or SSL v2.0 cipher suites 
    respectively.</li><br>

    <li>DH: cipher suites using DH, including anonymous DH.</li><br>

    <li>ADH: anonymous DH cipher suites.</li><br>

    <li>AES: cipher suites using AES.</li><br>

    <li>3DES: cipher suites using triple DES.</li><br>

    <li>DES: cipher suites using DES (not triple DES).</li><br>

    <li>RC4: cipher suites using RC4.</li><br>

    <li>RC2: cipher suites using RC2.</li><br>

    <li>IDEA: cipher suites using IDEA.</li><br>

    <li>MD5: cipher suites using MD5.</li><br>

    <li>SHA1, SHA: cipher suites using SHA1.</li><br>
</ul>

<br>
<p><h3><a name="ephemeral">Ephemeral Keying</a></h3></p>
As usually in SSL connections we shall use the RSA algorithm as it has the 
capabilities of doing most signing and encrypting. SSL can use it to perform
the key agreement necessary to create the shared key under which the data in 
the stream is encrypted. This technique, such as when the key exchange is 
conducted through a persistent key is called <i>static keying</i>. Building 
on this definition, <i>ephemeral keying</i> is defined as key exchange through
a temporary key. At first, it may seem that temporary keys may not allow for 
proper authentication -- not true. Generaly, with ephemeral keying, the 
authentication is accomplished through signature verification with persistent 
keys, and the temporary keys are used only for key agreement. There are two main
advantages of ephemeral keying over static keying from a security perspective.</p>

<p>Consider the case the certificates are based upon DSA keys. The DSA algorithm
provides a mechanism for signing but not for encrypting. Thus, having only DSA
keys on either side of an SSL connection leaves the protocol unable to perform key
exchange. It follows that static keying is not even an option for DSA-based
certificates; we must supplement them with ephemeral keys.</p>

<p>The second advantage is that they provide <i>forward secrecy</i>. At a high
level , forward secrecy means that if the private key is obtained by a third 
party, that third party will not be able to decode previous sessions conducted 
with that key or even future sessions conducted by someone else with the 
compromised key.</p>

<p>These two points make the benefits of using ephemeral keying clear. In terms of
SSL, using ephemeral keys essentially mandates that the keys embedded in the
certificates shall be used only for signatures and not for encryption. There are two
methods for key exchange in OpenSSL: temporary RSA keys or Diffie-Hellman (DH) key
agreement. Of these two choices, DH is better because temporary RSA keys violate the
SSL/TLS protocols. The RSA keying was originally implemented to make sure export
restrictions on cryptography were not violated. Today this issue is not a primary
concert; thus, ephemeral RSA keys tend not to be used. Additionally, generation of
these temporary RSA keys is much slower than using DH, presuming the DH parameters
are pre-generated.</p>
